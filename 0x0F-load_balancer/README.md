# 0x0F. Load balancer #


## Load balancers

A load balancer is a networking device or software component that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple web servers. Its primary purpose is to enhance the performance, availability, scalability and reliability of a website or web application by evenly distributing the workload among multiple servers. In this project, the load balancer component will be configured using HAProxy to distribute traffic among the two web servers (`web-01` and `web-02`).
